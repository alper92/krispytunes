            <p><em>"Since his youth, Alper has always been reliably making quality beats at such a delicious level that you are inevitably put in the mood to fill his motivating sounds with accurate punchlines - as well as all the other moods on the atmospheric keyboard. For about ten years that I have been appreciating him, he has always been a correct person too. He is blessed with a special talent for harmony, always producing authentic hiphop instrumentals."</em></p>
